# Customer Churn Analysis – Telecom Dataset 📊📉

This repository contains a **Customer Churn Analysis project** using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and machine learning.  
The objective is to analyze telecom customer data, identify patterns leading to churn, and build predictive models to reduce customer attrition.

## 🔍 Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Distribution of churned vs non-churned customers
  - Impact of contract type, tenure, charges, and demographics
- **Data Preprocessing**
  - Missing value treatment
  - Encoding categorical variables
  - Feature engineering (tenure bands, contract buckets, etc.)
- **Model Building**
  - Multiple machine learning algorithms
  - Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- **Deployment**
  - Trained model stored as `CBC.pkl`
  - `app.py` script to serve predictions
